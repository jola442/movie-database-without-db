## Server Instructions and General Information
1) Navigate to Projects in the Desktop folder and run server.js. It should take about fifteen seconds to start up. All resources in this database are stored in objects (users, movies, reviews and people). Therefore, whenever the server is restarted, the data is reset to its default state. That is, all resources added through POST requests are not saved. An initialization script in businessLogic.js extracts relevant information from movie-data-short.json and saves it to a “movies” variable. This script also creates 5 users (information about the users can be seen in businessLogic.js before the first function definition). For a sample user, you can enter the username "Jola" with the password "tears" or "Dave" with the password "joy". If you are using the sample users, the first letter of their username has to be capital. You can also look at information about the 3 other users in businessLogic.js as stated earlier or create a user of your own through the user interface. This script also makes each user write a basic review with a random score from 1-10 for each movie. The way recommended movies were implemented, if a user gives a movie a review score greater than or equal to 8, similar movies to that movie are recommended to the user. This however could cause a discrepancy between the reviews and the recommended movies. To properly test the recommended movies functionality, it is advisable to create new users and have them write reviews through the user interface. \ 

2) The "database" currently consists of 316 movies obtained from movie-data-short.json. The home page features a list of movie images and titles. Each title links to the corresponding movie page. The movies page features a list of movie titles with smaller movie images. Each title links to the corresponding movie page. For every page, all text in blue are links. The filter page allows users to search for movies with all required query parameters. There is also a search bar in the navigation bar of each page that allows users to search for people, users and one of the movie query parameters at a time. The sign-in link in the navigation bar appears only when a user is not logged in. Otherwise, a sign-out link is displayed. Once a user signs in (or registers), they gain access to a profile link in the navigation bar that takes them to their user profile. Once signed in, users can add reviews to movies by navigating to the movie page and typing in the "Score" field or the "Summary" and "Review Text" fields. If a user types in only the score field, it is considered a basic review. If the user does not give a summary but gives a review text and vice versa, the server sends a 400 response and alerts the user that it was unable to add the review.  \

3) To switch between a contributing and a normal user, navigate to the logged-in user's profile page and click on the change account type button. The panel that contains the profile picture tells you what type of account you currently have. Once you switch to a contributing user, you gain access to a contributor options link. The page can be accessed by normal users as well, but only if they manually enter the URL. Otherwise, the link does not show up for them. If a normal user tries to perform any actions on the page (adding a movie, adding a director etc.). The server sends a 401 response and the user is alerted that they are not authorized to carry out the action they just performed. The contributor-options page allows contributing users to add movies and people to the database. It also allows the addition of directors, actors and writers to movies. To select which action you would like to perform, simply change the option in the dropdown menu. When you elect to add new movies, an autofill button appears. This button fills the textboxes with randomly generated information. However, only 5 movies can be generated this way without editing the contents of the textboxes. This is because the randomized movie titles are in the format "Chelsea wins the {name of trophy}" and there are only 5 random trophies to pick from. The code for this can be found in clientjs/navbar.js. When viewing these auto-generated movies, a picture of a Chelsea FC team winning the trophy indicated is displayed as the movie picture. The names used are random first names and last names from 14 current Chelsea FC players. To test the recommended movies and most frequent collaborators functionality, it is advisable to manually add people to movies. The person page shows their top five most frequent collaborators. The user profile page shows at most ten recommended movies and each movie page shows at most ten similar movies.  People in the database who have collaborated with one person more than once include Selena Gomez, Joel Coen, Ethan Coen and Zac Efron to name a few. In the initialization script, I have commented out a list of a few other people currently in the database who also satisfy this criterion. When contributing users view movies, a plus button appears next to the list of directors, actors and writers. Once this button is clicked the user is prompted to type in a name that would be added to the system. This is an alternative way of adding directors, actors and writers to movies. \
